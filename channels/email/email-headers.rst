Email header manipulation
*************************

Email header manipulation allows you to re-route or adjust tickets apart from
filters or triggers. Like an API call, but much more different.

Header checks are case insensitive.

.. warning:: **üõ° Trusted channels required üõ°**

   Below options are a potential risk with external communication and
   thus require channels being set to trusted explicitly.

.. tip::

   Below headers are examples and ‚Äìin our opinion‚Äì the most relevant ones.
   However: You can adjust mostly any article or ticket attribute (yes, custoom
   ones as well) if you know the attributes exact name.

   The name column within :doc:`/system/objects` provides easy access to
   objects attribute names. ü§ì

Trigger auto responses
----------------------

Normally Zammad runs internal checks to see if an email is an automatic
response. In these cases Zammad will not send trigger based responses.

There may be use cases where this behavior may be in your way,
below options allow you to overcome this issue.

   .. note::

      In some cases combining below headers is crucial.
      This is intentional but may be confusing.

``x-zammad-send-auto-response``
   Set to ``false`` to disable trigger based responses.
   If set to ``true`` Zammad will send a response.

      .. hint::

         This option *does not* work if e.g. ``precedence: list`` is set
         unless you use below auto response header as well.

``x-zammad-is-auto-response``
   Providing this header allows you to tell Zammad that the mail in question
   is an auto generated response (``true``). This will cause email based
   triggers to be skipped.

   Set this header to ``false`` if you want to generate auto responses.

      .. tip::

         This header allows you to overwrite auto detects for e.g.
         ``precedence: list``.

Ticket attributes
-----------------

Zammad allows you to use headers to manipulate ticket creations or follow ups.
The manipulation can be used instead of triggers. Triggers are considered
*after* header settings and thus can still overrule.

   .. note:: **üîé Zammad differentiates in between ticket creation and follow up**

      | For creations use: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-{Attribute Name}``
      | For follow ups use: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-{Attribute Name}``

      This allows you to ensure the changes are only applied in the
      required situation.

   .. warning:: **üßê About values**

      * While headers are case insensitive, values like e.g. priority names
        are case censitive: ``1 low`` will work, but ``1 lOw`` will not!
      * When using attributes that require datetime values, ensure to use
        Time Zoned Times. e.g. for 28th September 2021 on 8 am CEST, either use:

            * ``2021-09-28T08:00:00+0200``
            * ``2021-09-28T08:00:00+02:00``
            * ``2021-09-28T06:00:00.000Z``

``X-Zammad-Ticket-Priority`` & ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-Priority``
   | Allows you to adjust a tickets priority.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-Priority: 1 low``

``X-Zammad-Ticket-Group`` & ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-Group``
   | Allows you interfere with regular channel routing of the ticket.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-Group: Sales``

``X-Zammad-Ticket-Owner`` & ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-Owner``
   | Directly assign or change the ticket owner. Valid values are either
     ``login`` or ``email``
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-Owner: jdoe``

``X-Zammad-Ticket-State`` & ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-State``
   | Set a specific ticket state.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Ticket-State: closed``

      .. note::

         | Pending states always require the ``pending_time`` attribute on top. 
         | Like so: 
           ``X-Zammad-Ticket-FollowUp-Pending_Time: 2021-09-26T08:00:00+0200``

``X-Zammad-Customer-Email``
   | Manipulate the ticket customer - this can be a different user than the
     actual sender. Replying to the original sender is still possible.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Customer-Email: jdoe@example.com``

      .. note::

         This header is not available for follow ups.

``X-Zammad-Customer-Login``
   | Manipulate the ticket customer - this can be a different user than the
     actual sender. Replying to the original sender is still possible.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Customer-Login: jdoe``

      .. note::

         This header is not available for follow ups.

Article attributes
------------------

If needed Zammad allows you to manipulate attributes or states of fetched
email articles.

``X-Zammad-Article-Sender``
   | Manipulate the sender type (Agent, Customer or System)
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Article-Sender: System``

      .. warning::

         System emails are indicated by the trigger sendout like entries.
         Users can't see them natively.

         .. figure:: /images/channels/email/headers/email-header-as-system.png
            :alt: Received mail as article sender system
            :width: 75%

``X-Zammad-Article-Type``
   | Change the article type of your incoming mail. This requires you to know
     the article types being available to your system.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Article-Type: phone``

      .. warning::

         This header can cause *serious issues* in your instance and may
         lead to absolute unexpected behavior. Only use with absolute care!

``X-Zammad-Article-Internal``
   | Manipulate the default article visibility.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Article-Internal: true``

``X-Zammad-Ignore``
   | Tell Zammad to silently drop the email.
   | Example: ``X-Zammad-Ignore: true``
