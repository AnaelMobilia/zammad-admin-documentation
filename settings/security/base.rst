New User Accounts
-----------------

.. container:: cfloat-left

   Activated the `register as a new customer` function on the login page.
   If set to ``no`` only administrators or agents can create new accounts
   manually.

   Default setting: ``yes``

.. warning:: **ðŸ˜– This setting may be confusing**
   
   Deactivation of above function **does not** deactivate automatic account
   creation! This means: If a user write e.g. an email to Zammad and has no
   account yet, Zammad will automatically create the account.

   User accounts are a direct dependency of tickets and thus technically
   mandatory.

Lost Password
-------------

.. container:: cfloat-left

   Activates the `lost password` function on the login page.
   If set to ``no`` only administrators may change the users password - users
   may update their own password if they're still logged in and they have the
   required :doc:`permission </manage/roles/user-preferences-permissions>`.

   Default setting: ``yes``

.. container:: cfloat-right

   .. figure:: /images/settings/security/login_lost_password.png

      :width: 60%
      :align: center

.. tip:: **ðŸ˜– This function may confuse users**

   With third party authentications - but especially LDAP you may want to
   disable this function. Zammad **will not** change third party login
   passwords and instead set or change the local password!

Session Timeout
---------------

All settings below by default are set to ``4 weeks``.
Session Timeout defines the life time of a users session.
As soon reached, Zammad will automatically log off the session in question.

Zammad takes the highest value set assigned for the user based on
the permissions.

   #. ``admin``
   #. ``ticket.agent``
   #. ``ticket.customer``
   #. ``default`` (fallback if user doesn't have above permissions set)

All settings act independent on each other allowing you to disable the
timeouts for e.g. admins, but not agents.

   .. note:: **ðŸ¤“ An example**

      Let's suppose you configured the following session timeouts
         * default: 3 weeks
         * admin: 2 weeks
         * ticket.agent: 4 weeks
         * ticket.customer: 1 week

      This results in the following situations
         - a user with ``admin`` permission will have a timeout of 2 weeks
         - a user with ``admin`` and ``ticket.agent`` permissions will
           have a timeout of 2 weeks
         - a user with ``ticket.customer`` permission will have a timeout
           of 1 week
         - a user with neither ``admin``, ``ticket.agent`` nor
           ``ticket.customer`` permissions will have a timeout of 3 weeks
