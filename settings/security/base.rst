*New User Accounts*
   Enables users to create their own account via web interface.

*Lost Password*
   Activates lost password feature for users. If "no" is selected here, the
   password can only be changed via the admin interface.

.. hint:: Normally, especially when using LDAP, you might want to consider to
          disable both above options, because you'd normally do that via LDAP.
