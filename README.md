## Notes on Documentation Branches and Pull Requests

The most current version is **always**  ``main`` - if you create Pull Requests,
please use ``main`` as destination Branch.

This will ensure that your changes are available upon merge.


## Local tests (mostly internal stuff)

If you want to test the doc for yourself you need a local installation of sphinx and gettext.

```
pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx-intl sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx-version-warning
```


### Example for a local HTML build

```
make html
```

### Example workflow for localization using transifex

If you have to work on the translations you need gettext.

For OS X use HomeBrew or build from source. For Linux use your package
manager.

```
brew install gettext
```

The workflow itself
```
# create .tx config
$ tx init

# ensure clean enviroment
$ make clean

# generate the strings from the *.rst files
$ make gettext

# OPTIONAL: if you have to adapt a new locale, run
sphinx-intl update -p _build/locale/ -l de

# update the resource files from the pot dir
$ sphinx-intl update-txconfig-resources --pot-dir _build/locale --transifex-project-name zammad-admin-documentation

# push to transifex (if configured)
$ tx push -s

# Below pull options by default ignore unreviewed (see https://docs.transifex.com/client/pull#getting-different-file-variants )
# after translation pull needed languages from transifex
$ tx pull -l en

# build the .MO files for use with readthedocs
# (After a successful build, push to this repo and readthedocs will update itself.)
$ sh build_mo.sh

# manual language-based build (`_build/html/`) (for testing)
$ make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='de'" html
$ make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D language='en'" html
```

If you have a problem, please create an issue. Thanks.
