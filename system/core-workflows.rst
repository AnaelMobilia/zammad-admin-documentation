Core Workflows
==============

Core Workflows allow you to create complex ticket processes just as
(but not limited to):

   * show / hide
   * adjust mandatory setting
   * manipulate available options

With this, you're all set to provide exactly those information you really need!

.. note:: 

   * If the pre-defined :doc:`/system/objects` are not enough,
     please add them beforehand.
   * If you experience slow or unreliable field updates, please see
     :ref:`Core Workflow Ajax Modus <core-workflow-ajax-mode>`

.. warning::

   This is a very enhanced functionality and can cause unexpected UI behavior.
   Please ensure to test your use cases after configuration to reduce surprises.
