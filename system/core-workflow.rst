Core Workflow
=============

Core Workflow allows you to create complex ticket process just as
(but not limited to):

   * show / hide
   * adjust mandatory setting
   * manipulate available options

With this you're all set to provide exactly those information you really need!

.. note:: 

   If pre defined :doc:`/system/objects` are not enough,
   please add them before hand.

.. warning::

   This is a very enhanced functionality and can cause unexpected UI behavior.
   Please ensure to test your use cases after configuration to reduce surprises.
