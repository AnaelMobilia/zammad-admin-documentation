S/MIME
======

S/MIME is the most widely-supported method for secure email communication.
With S/MIME, you can exchange **signed** and **encrypted** messages with others.

Signing
   is proof that a message hasnâ€™t been tampered with or sent by an impersonator.

   In other words, it guarantees a messageâ€™s **integrity** and **authenticity**.

Encryption
   scrambles a message so that it can only be unscrambled by the intended recipient.

   In other words, it guarantees **privacy** and **data security**.

   Once S/MIME has been enabled, ðŸ”’ **Encrypt** and âœ… **Sign** buttons will appear in the ticket composer.

Limitation
----------

Please note that Zammad by default distrust senders.
This means that you're always required to provide certificate data, no matter
if for signing or encrypting.

This is by design and can't be adjusted.

Default Behavior
----------------

The ticket composer will set all outgoing messages
to **signed and encrypted** by default
(assuming the required certificates exist).

These defaults can be modified on a per-group basis:

Of course, agents can always manually change these settings
on each email they send out.

Usage
-----
