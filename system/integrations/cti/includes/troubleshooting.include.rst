Troubleshooting
---------------

My Phone page stays blank, signalling does work...
   If you've made sure that signalling works (check Recent logs) and your
   Caller Log still stays empty, please ensure that you only configured one
   CTI integration version. Specifically defining more than one agent mapping on
   the different integration variants will be the issue.

   Clear the not needed agent mapping and reload your browser page.
